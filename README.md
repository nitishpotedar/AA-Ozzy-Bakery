The aim of the project is to apply analytical methods to practical business problems. Each team will need to identify and model a real-world optimization problem. The project entails applying the concepts from class to define the problem, build an optimization model, and solve it.

Teams should first brainstorm from their personal connections to help identify a business establishment that could benefit from your optimization skills. These can include a problem that can be fully solved: that is, the data is available, and the solution techniques are also available. Or they can involve more
complex problems in which students focus on what they would do if they could not solve the full problem. In the latter case, students should still collect some data and carry out some optimization for some aspect of their problem.

Teams must also collect data (using surveys, online data sources, focus groups, etc.) to validate and solve the model. Successful projects will include a variety of techniques learned in class (e.g., modeling, Solver, sensitivity analysis). They may also involve knowledge or techniques from other classes (e.g.,
data analysis). The project should include a qualitative assessment of the situation and a quantitative component.

Some specific points to consider with your course project.
1. Identify practical applications for concepts learned in class
2. Conduct analysis while leveraging course material
3. Learn about assorted real-life situations where optimization methods can be used
4. Learn about applying optimization in practice, including learning the difficulties that may be associated with finding the right data and forming a useful model.
